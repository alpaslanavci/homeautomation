**EE241 Home Automation Project**

This project aims to implement a smart house system using Verilog HDL. With this project, we are trying to help residents control their house.  
This project is managed by the following students: Alpaslan AvcÄ± (20220701013), Adnan Tolga Aksoy (***)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The systems listed below will be implemented in our Home Automation System:

  * 0--> Authorization
  * 1--> General Management System
    * 1.1 --> Lighting Control
    * 1.2 --> White Goods Control
    * 1.3 --> Curtains, Windows and Doors Control
  * 2--> Climate Control System
    * 2.1 --> AC Control
    * 2.2 --> Heating Systems Control
  * 3--> Safety System
    * 3.1 --> Fire Dedector and Fire Extinguish Systems
    * 3.2 --> Burglar Dedection Systems
  * 4--> Energy Management System

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Authorization**
  The aim of this system is to set which residents (or who, in general) can have access to home automation system. This is going to be done with the help of ID and Password. Each user    will be attained an ID and a password, which then they will be authorized by our application to reach and control the automation system. Unauthorized users will not be able to       
  control.

**General Management Systems**
  With this system residents are going to have control over many aspects inside the house. The following actions will be doable:
    - Turn on/off each lighting connected to the home automation system.
    - Turn on/off each white goods connected to the home automation system.
    - Open/close each door, curtaion or window connected to the home automation system.

**Climate Control System**
  With this system residents are going to have control over the AC and heating systems. The following actions will be doable:
    - Turn on/off AC.
    - Set AC to any mode it has.
    - Turn on/off heating systems.
    - Set heating systems to any mode it has.

**Safety System**
  With this system residents are going to be aware of some hazard s
